## Description
I wanted to create a website that allows me to take notes and have these notes saved into a database. Now, if I go back to the website on a different computer, my notes will be saved and retrieved.

## Installation

## Usage
Once you enter the website, press on the 'Get Started' button to enter the note taker functionality. Now you can add a title and a body to your note. Once you're done with writing the note, press the save button on the top right. Now your note will appear on the left-hand side. If you click on a note title on the left-hand side, it will load on the right hand side. You can then add another new note by pressing on the + button on the top right. If you're done with a specific note or task, you can delete it by pressing on the bin button.
